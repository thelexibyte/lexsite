As you've might seen today, I've launched a new front-end of my website for old browsers, made completely with 
**Microsoft FrontPage 2003**, and well, today I'll be telling the type of bugs I had to go through...

#### The begining

At the start it was pretty nice, I had the "Split" view enabled since I wasn't so sure about the whole WYSIWYG and that stuff, it was kinda nice and I did a nice test page, but then the problems arose..

##### The navegation bar

If you are vieweing this on the modern website, this is how it looks like:

![Horibyte Website Retro Front-end navegation bar](/blog/img/2025-03-09/navbar.png){:style="width:-moz-available;height:auto;"}

And oh boy, it was sure painful to get everything right...

Here are some screenshots of me not getting it to work cuz I have no idea how to explain it:

![](/blog/img/2025-03-09/discord-thing-2.png){:style="width:-moz-available;height:auto;"}

![](/blog/img/2025-03-09/discord-thing-3.png){:style="width:-moz-available;height:auto;"}

![](/blog/img/2025-03-09/discord-thing-4.png){:style="width:-moz-available;height:auto;"}

As you can see, it was trial and error to get the navbar..bar to get fully working, which took 7 hours between 2 days of fixing...yeah I could do it in like 15 mins or so but nah this took me that amount of time. Insane.

Not only it didn't just want to put the text properly, I had to come up with some weird fixes for it to even go to the max of the screen like it does now.

##### Blog, and centering, too

You thought the blog didn't have its issues, nah, it did.

Even tho I don't have more screenshots of it, it was kind of pain to make the blog homepage work, here's another example

![](/blog/img/2025-03-09/discord-thing-6.png){:style="width:-moz-available;height:auto;"}

Yeah things also refused to center properly, as you can see here:

![](/blog/img/2025-03-09/discord-thing-5.png){:style="width:-moz-available;height:auto;"}

Something that always annoyed me is that the Design mode is not really accurate to the preview, which made debugging it like 10x harder.

Lists/bullets didn't want to work either with the fix I added which was weird..

When I was done with the navbar + blog, I just went to port everything else which was easy, I made the Projects and Socials page be lists cuz I'm NOT bothering to make the goddamn boxes after all I did for a single box.

#### Conclusion

In the end, everything went out alright, it's just that I suck with WYSIWYG, mainly because I'm already used to coding in general.


<div class="container" style="color: lightgray; font-size: small;">
You tell me people didn't have to debug the heck out of an HTML file for it to only be a missing &lt;/div&gt;? Insane!
