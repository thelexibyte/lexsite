As you've might seen on January 1st, 2025, things about me were different already, new year, new me took seriously, innit?

This post will go into the reasoning why I'm now the persona known as "Horibyte", keep reading to see more.

#### Before New Years Eve

If you've known me for a while before 2025, you might seen me be called "Stuffy", the name lore goes kinda deep tbh, but this post is not about that name.

Everything was alright just like a normal person would be in Discord...sorta lmfao

ANYWAY around July '24 I rebranded myself to StuffyXP, the branding was already out..sorta, my username was stuffyxp in other places around with Discord as well, but in July I made the StuffyXP Branding you know today, completely replacing my old branding with Dogui.

Around November '24 I was thinking of rebranding myself to something else, that month was when I looked for ideas for a new alias, what kickstarted the thought was when my friend Lynx rebranding himself to Clyron (we don't talk about Sunn shhhhhh).

The ideas were brainstormed, with alot of them coming out of the blue, some guy on a Discord Server suggested "Horizon", even though I wouldn't use it, I did think of adding something else to the name

- Horizone
- Horiflat
- Horiflake
- Hori*idklol*....

..All of these were ideas for my new alias, the 3rd one, Horiflake, was the one who was the more appealing to me, even though it didn't really recieve alot of positive feedback, I still wanted it, bbbbbbbut I got a comment that just....no, it's fucking lewd and I don't want to say what is was, first because NSFW and second, I don't want to bring it up for that person to not get hate or smth idk.

After all of that, another brainstorming session came in, this time with my friend Clyron, we both brainstormed ideas for it, until the name "Horibyte" came in, we both liked it.

##### What now...

After the name was decided as soon as early December 2024, I began to try to come up with the branding, I actually got it first try....sorta.

The wordmark, banner and pfp were done in 2 hours that day, I do still have the files, here they are I guess...
<div style="position: relative; margin: 0 auto; display:block;" id="bannerandpfp">
    <img src="/blog/img/2025-02-12/hb-pfp.png" alt="old horibyte pfp" width="22%" height="22%">
    <img src="/blog/img/2025-02-12/hb-banner.png" alt="old horibyte banner" width="39.35%" height="39.35%">
</div>

![old horibyte wordmark](/blog/img/2025-02-12/hb-wordmark.png){: style="max-width: 50%; height: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;"}

As you can see, these early versions look similar to the current branding you know today, by chance one thing I did was make one of the star's eye blink, and the `01` on the pfp was removed too, after that, I was done.
I almost changed everything but Clyron suggested to do it on December 31st/January 1st, which I did.

Being Horibyte now, it honestly feels great to be someone with the name I wanted to have, the Stuffy/StuffyXP name family was kept due to legacy of my older aliases, but I thought that it was dated, and the new star on the horizon (get it?) passed and uhh idk what more lmfao

Either way I like the name Horibyte, planning for it to last longer than 12 months üò≠üôè

#### But why?

Well now we are onto the reasoning why I am not Stuffy/StuffyXP anymore. Well...it's actually a couple of reasons lmao

I will just do a list with MD so its easier lol

- **Being myself**: This change was for the best in my life, as I could be whoever I wanted to be without basically just ""drowning"" my channel as I had its name for myself too, back then I was a normal he/him guy, but now I'm just a silli aroace he/they/it guy ‚ú®

- **Breaking the legacy**: It simply felt outdated to keep that name tradition since 2021, and it just didn't let me who I wanted to be, this is related to the first reason, too.

- **Moving on from my past self**: My past self was just....kinda cringe and just not very good person in general, I wasn't mean or anything, but looking back I just don't like it anymore, since whatever happened from March to July 2024, I changed as a whole, new me innit, this rebrand has def helped me out on moving on from all of that shit, no blog post for it though.

<p style="text-align:center;">This image fits the thing perfectly lol</p>

- **And for last but not least......being someone who is more likeable i guess**: This one doesn't make sense..sorta, what I mean is that with this new name and stuff, I just seem someone who is nice and stuff than the name StuffyXP (i realized what it could prob mean a while ago), i've met alot of new people than I ever really did on that ""name family tree"" thing I had, and honestly, I'm glad I made these changes.

#### Miscellaneous

These are some things that happened in the making of this blog post which I'd like to talk about.

##### Leaving Discord

A few days ago at the start of February, I left Discord (no shit bruv), mainly simply because from December '24 to January '25 was just fucking shit to me, I just got alot of ""drama"" (it's not really drama its just having mental breakdowns and shit lmfao).

Due to all of that, I just left the platform in favor of [Revolt](<https://revolt.chat>), with a server only with my very close friends so we can hang out, just so I'm not entirely alone.

The StuffyXP Hangout is still open, the ownership was transfered to my bestie Clyron, the server is dead without me so I don't expect anything from it anymore.

I do not have a date for my comeback, but just how my life has been the shittiest it could've been, and with just...Discord...y'know how Discord is and you prob know what I am talking about, yeah I just dont want to make it worse.

##### Horicraft

Nothing bad about this entirely, I recently (well not recently it was like 3 weeks ago whatever) a Minecraft Server, we have a lot of things and my friends and I have fun in it, the address is `home-appointment.gl.joinmc.link` is you wanna check us out, there might be some inside jokes here and there, but nothing unusual lol.

##### HoriWebsite, StuffyXP Website & WOU

These are the codenames of my websites, I only mantain one, HoriWebsite (which is the one you are on right now), and I felt like it just wasn't necessary to just have them all there, what I did today was push one final bugfix update (ik it was like 7 more but I don't count them if you count them I will send you to Jesus), then archived the repo, both STXP Website and WOU are in the same repo, which is at [https://github.com/horibyte/stuffyxp-website](<https://github.com/horibyte/stuffyxp-website>) (ik it should've been `stuffyxp-websites` BUT I'M NOT BOTHERING TO CHANGE THE URLS AGAIN STICK WITH IT.).

The major elephant in the room with those updates were to change the URLs from `/css/main.css` to `/stuffyxp-website/css/main.css` (that is just an example.) the entire process took like 30 minutes to do at its base, I also added some new things since it could basically be considered a new build even though it was an update on the backend of it.

This is what I added/updated on the frontend:

- New changelog added
- Added a link to the HoriWebsite in the Other dropdown
- Updated the copyright text on 2.1

This was just a side project that I did for fun since today was just boring in general, the repo is archived, I also cleaned my GitHub profile, getting rid of some repos and shit, I still don't know how do the downloads work since it's at `stuffyxp.github.io` though.

You can check the website out at [https://horibyte.is-a.dev/stuffyxp-website](<https://horibyte.is-a.dev/stuffyxp-website>).

##### StuffyXP Channel(s)

The channel recently have been streaming a series of....streams in the past few days, a **Windows Upgrade Saga** of sorts, it took me like 3 streams to get it right, and I just started over, the reset went pretty good so far, and we managed to get to Windows 11 via the "win11 esd-win10 setup" method, which by its names implies, you use the Windows 10 setup GUI and shit, but replace 10's install.esd with 11's install.esd, it was fun, fun fact: that was my second WinUpgradeSaga ever, I first did one in 2019 but failed and was stuck at Windows 98 since VirtualBox, Windows 98 and a Celeron 420 don't mix up well apparently.

StuffyXP's at 221 subs at the time of writing this, thanks guys! :D

###### What about Horibyte?

Around a few days ago I uploaded a YouTube Short called "when the boredom makes you do silly things ‚ú®", where I just BSOD'ded my laptop in sync with the Staff Roll Remake from *Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story + Bowser Jr.'s Journey*. It blew up with 500+ views, I don't know how and why, but it did, now the Icefield Showcase from Jan 2025 is not my only video lmao.

#### Conclusion

After all of what happened, I am now the persona known as Horibyte, which is one of the best decisions I ever did on my life IMO.

Thanks for readin' this!!

*Fun Fact 2: This blog post was made entirely in a day! It normally takes me like 3 days to make one, gotta go fast I guess lmfao.*
